    <h1>Interview with ShowMax</h1>
    <aside>Posted at: May 1, 2016 by Brian Brazil</aside>
    <article class="doc-content">
      <p><em>This is the second in a series of interviews with users of Prometheus, allowing
them to share their experiences of evaluating and using Prometheus.</em></p>

<h2 id="can-you-tell-us-about-yourself-and-what-showmax-does?">Can you tell us about yourself and what ShowMax does?<a class="header-anchor" href="#can-you-tell-us-about-yourself-and-what-showmax-does" name="can-you-tell-us-about-yourself-and-what-showmax-does"></a>
</h2>

<p>I’m Antonin Kral, and I’m leading research and architecture for
<a href="http://www.showmax.com">ShowMax</a>. Before that, I’ve held architectural and CTO
roles for the past 12 years.</p>

<p>ShowMax is a subscription video on demand service that launched in South Africa
in 2015. We’ve got an extensive content catalogue with more than 20,000
episodes of TV shows and movies. Our service is currently available in 65
countries worldwide. While better known rivals are skirmishing in America and
Europe, ShowMax is battling a more difficult problem: how do you binge-watch
in a barely connected village in sub-Saharan Africa? Already 35% of video
around the world is streamed, but there are still so many places the revolution
has left untouched.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2016-05-01/showmax-logo-cb5f41c49fe.png" alt="ShowMax logo"></p>

<p>We are managing about 50 services running mostly on private clusters built
around CoreOS. They are primarily handling API requests from our clients
(Android, iOS, AppleTV, JavaScript, Samsung TV, LG TV etc), while some of them
are used internally. One of the biggest internal pipelines is video encoding
which can occupy 400+ physical servers when handling large ingestion batches.</p>

<p>The majority of our back-end services are written in Ruby, Go or Python. We use
EventMachine when writing apps in Ruby (Goliath on MRI, Puma on JRuby). Go is
typically used in apps that require large throughput and don’t have so much
business logic. We’re very happy with Falcon for services written in Python.
Data is stored in PostgreSQL and ElasticSearch clusters. We use etcd and custom
tooling for configuring Varnishes for routing requests.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-your-pre-prometheus-monitoring-experience?">What was your pre-Prometheus monitoring experience?<a class="header-anchor" href="#what-was-your-pre-prometheus-monitoring-experience" name="what-was-your-pre-prometheus-monitoring-experience"></a>
</h2>

<p>The primary use-cases for monitoring systems are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Active monitoring and probing (via Icinga)</li>
<li>Metrics acquisition and creation of alerts based on these metrics (now Prometheus)</li>
<li>Log acquisition from backend services</li>
<li>Event and log acquisition from apps</li>
</ul>

<p>The last two use-cases are handled via our logging infrastructure. It consists
of a collector running in the service container, which is listening on local
Unix socket. The socket is used by apps to send messages to the outside world.
Messages are transferred via RabbitMQ servers to consumers. Consumers are
custom written or hekad based. One of the main message flows is going towards
the service ElasticSearch cluster, which makes logs accessible for Kibana and
ad-hoc searches. We also save all processed events to GlusterFS for archival
purposes and/or further processing.</p>

<p>We used to run two metric acquisition pipelines in parallel. The first is based
on Collectd + StatsD + Graphite + Grafana and the other using Collectd +
OpenTSDB. We have struggled considerably with both pipelines. We had to deal
with either the I/O hungriness of Graphite, or the complexity and inadequate
tooling around OpenTSDB.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-decide-to-look-at-prometheus?">Why did you decide to look at Prometheus?<a class="header-anchor" href="#why-did-you-decide-to-look-at-prometheus" name="why-did-you-decide-to-look-at-prometheus"></a>
</h2>

<p>After learning from our problems with the previous monitoring system, we looked
for a replacement. Only a few solutions made it to our shortlist. Prometheus
was one of the first, as Jiri Brunclik, our head of Operations at the time, had
received a personal recommendation about the system from former colleagues at
Google.</p>

<p>The proof of concept went great. We got a working system very quickly. We also
evaluated InfluxDB as a main system as well as a long-term storage for
Prometheus. But due to recent developments, this may no longer be a viable
option for us.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-transition?">How did you transition?<a class="header-anchor" href="#how-did-you-transition" name="how-did-you-transition"></a>
</h2>

<p>We initially started with LXC containers on one of our service servers, but
quickly moved towards a dedicated server from Hetzner, where we host the
majority of our services. We’re using PX70-SSD, which is Intel® Xeon® E3-1270
v3 Quad-Core Haswell with 32GB RAM, so we have plenty of power to run
Prometheus. SSDs allow us to have retention set to 120 days. Our logging
infrastructure is built around getting logs locally (receiving them on Unix
socket) and then pushing them towards the various workers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2016-05-01/Loggin_infrastructure-cb619dee745.png" alt="Diagram of ShowMax logging infrastructure. Shows flow of log messages from the source via processors to various consumers."></p>

<p>Having this infrastructure available made pushing metrics a logical choice
(especially in pre-Prometheus times). On the other side, Prometheus is
primarily designed around the paradigm of scraping metrics. We wanted to stay
consistent and push all metrics towards Prometheus initially. We have created a
Go daemon called prometheus-pusher. It’s responsible for scraping metrics from
local exporters and pushing them towards the Pushgateway. Pushing metrics has
some positive aspects (e.g. simplified service discovery) but also quite a few
drawbacks (e.g. making it hard to distinguish between a network partition vs. a
crashed service). We made Prometheus-pusher available on
<a href="https://github.com/ShowMax/prometheus-pusher">GitHub</a>, so you can try it
yourself.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2016-05-01/log_processors-cb9d9ba8407.png" alt="Grafana dashboard showing April 5th 2016 log processors traffic."></p>

<p>The next step was for us to figure out what to use for managing dashboards and
graphs. We liked the Grafana integration, but didn’t really like how Grafana
manages dashboard configurations. We are running Grafana in a Docker
container, so any changes should be kept out of the container. Another problem
was the lack of change tracking in Grafana.</p>

<p>We have thus decided to write a generator which takes YAML maintained within
git and generates JSON configs for Grafana dashboards. It is furthermore able to
deploy dashboards to Grafana started in a fresh container without the need for
persisting changes made into the container. This provides you with automation,
repeatability, and auditing.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that this tool is also now available under an Apache
2.0 license on <a href="https://github.com/ShowMax/grafana-dashboards-generator">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-improvements-have-you-seen-since-switching?">What improvements have you seen since switching?<a class="header-anchor" href="#what-improvements-have-you-seen-since-switching" name="what-improvements-have-you-seen-since-switching"></a>
</h2>

<p>An improvement which we saw immediately was the stability of Prometheus. We
were fighting with stability and scalability of Graphite prior to this, so
getting that sorted was a great win for us. Furthermore the speed and stability
of Prometheus made access to metrics very easy for developers. Prometheus is
really helping us to embrace the DevOps culture.</p>

<p>Tomas Cerevka, one of our backend developers, was testing a new version of the
service using JRuby. He needed a quick peek into the heap consumption of that
particular service. He was able to get that information in a snap. For us,
this speed is essential.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2016-05-01/ui_fragments-heap-zoom-cb713bf2cb9.png" alt="Heap size consumed by JRuby worker during troubleshooting memory issues on JVM."></p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-think-the-future-holds-for-showmax-and-prometheus?">What do you think the future holds for ShowMax and Prometheus?<a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-you-think-the-future-holds-for-showmax-and-prometheus" name="what-do-you-think-the-future-holds-for-showmax-and-prometheus"></a>
</h2>

<p>Prometheus has become an integral part of monitoring in ShowMax and it is going
to be with us for the foreseeable future. We have replaced our whole metric
storage with Prometheus, but the ingestion chain remains push based. We are
thus thinking about following Prometheus best practices and switching to a pull
model.</p>

<p>We’ve also already played with alerts. We want to spend more time on this topic
and come up with increasingly sophisticated alert rules.</p>
