    <h1>Interview with JustWatch</h1>
    <aside>Posted at: October 12, 2016 by Brian Brazil</aside>
    <article class="doc-content">
      <p><em>Continuing our series of interviews with users of Prometheus, JustWatch talks
about how they established their monitoring.</em></p>

<h2 id="can-you-tell-us-about-yourself-and-what-justwatch-does?">Can you tell us about yourself and what JustWatch does?<a class="header-anchor" href="#can-you-tell-us-about-yourself-and-what-justwatch-does" name="can-you-tell-us-about-yourself-and-what-justwatch-does"></a>
</h2>

<p>For consumers, <a href="https://www.justwatch.com">JustWatch</a> is a streaming search
engine that helps to find out where to watch movies and TV shows legally online
and in theaters. You can search movie content across all major streaming
providers like Netflix, HBO, Amazon Video, iTunes, Google Play, and many others
in 17 countries.</p>

<p>For our clients like movie studios or Video on Demand providers, we are an
international movie marketing company that collects anonymized data about
purchase behavior and movie taste of fans worldwide from our consumer apps. We
help studios to advertise their content to the right audience and make digital
video advertising a lot more efficient in minimizing waste coverage.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2016-10-12/JW_logo_long_black-cb56076c127.jpg" alt="JustWatch logo"></p>

<p>Since our launch in 2014 we went from zero to one of the largest 20k websites
internationally without spending a single dollar on marketing - becoming the
largest streaming search engine worldwide in under two years. Currently, with
an engineering team of just 10, we build and operate a fully dockerized stack
of about 50 micro- and macro-services, running mostly on
<a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-your-pre-prometheus-monitoring-experience?">What was your pre-Prometheus monitoring experience?<a class="header-anchor" href="#what-was-your-pre-prometheus-monitoring-experience" name="what-was-your-pre-prometheus-monitoring-experience"></a>
</h2>

<p>At prior companies many of us worked with most of the open-source monitoring
products there are. We have quite some experience working with
<a href="https://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a>, <a href="https://www.icinga.org/">Icinga</a>,
<a href="http://www.zabbix.com/">Zabbix</a>,
<a href="https://mmonit.com/monit/documentation/">Monit</a>,
<a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a>, <a href="https://graphiteapp.org/">Graphite</a> and
a few other systems. At one company I helped build a distributed Nagios setup
with Puppet. This setup was nice, since new services automatically showed up in
the system, but taking instances out was still painful. As soon as you have
some variance in your systems, the host and service based monitoring suites
just don’t fit quite well. The label-based approach Prometheus took was
something I always wanted to have, but didn’t find before.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-decide-to-look-at-prometheus?">Why did you decide to look at Prometheus?<a class="header-anchor" href="#why-did-you-decide-to-look-at-prometheus" name="why-did-you-decide-to-look-at-prometheus"></a>
</h2>

<p>At JustWatch the public Prometheus announcement hit exactly the right time. We
mostly had blackbox monitoring for the first few months of the company -
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">CloudWatch</a> for some of the most important
internal metrics, combined with a external services like
<a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a> for detecting site-wide outages. Also, none
of the classical host-based solutions satisfied us. In a world of containers
and microservices, host-based tools like Icinga,
<a href="https://www.thruk.org/">Thruk</a> or Zabbix felt antiquated and not ready for the
job. When we started to investigate whitebox monitoring, some of us luckily
attended the Golang Meetup where Julius and Björn announced Prometheus. We
quickly set up a Prometheus server and started to instrument our Go services
(we use almost only Go for the backend). It was amazing how easy that was - the
design felt like being cloud- and service-oriented as a first principle and
never got in the way.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-transition?">How did you transition?<a class="header-anchor" href="#how-did-you-transition" name="how-did-you-transition"></a>
</h2>

<p>Transitioning wasn't that hard, as timing wise, we were lucky enough to go from
no relevant monitoring directly to Prometheus.</p>

<p>The transition to Prometheus was mostly including the Go client into our apps
and wrapping the HTTP handlers. We also wrote and deployed several exporters,
including the <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter">node_exporter</a> and
several exporters for cloud provider APIs. In our experience monitoring and
alerting is a project that is never finished, but the bulk of the work was done
within a few weeks as a side project.</p>

<p>Since the deployment of Prometheus we tend to look into metrics whenever we
miss something or when we are designing new services from scratch.</p>

<p>It took some time to fully grasp the elegance of PromQL and labels concept
fully, but the effort really paid off.</p>

<h2 id="what-improvements-have-you-seen-since-switching?">What improvements have you seen since switching?<a class="header-anchor" href="#what-improvements-have-you-seen-since-switching" name="what-improvements-have-you-seen-since-switching"></a>
</h2>

<p>Prometheus enlightened us by making it incredibly easy to reap the benefits
from whitebox monitoring and label-based canary deployments. The out-of-the-box
metrics for many Golang aspects (HTTP Handler, Go Runtime) helped us to get to
a return on investment very quickly - goroutine metrics alone saved the day
multiple times. The only monitoring component we actually liked before -
<a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> - feels like a natural fit for Prometheus and
has allowed us to create some very helpful dashboards. We appreciated that
Prometheus didn't try to reinvent the wheel but rather fit in perfectly with
the best solution out there. Another huge improvement on predecessors was
Prometheus's focus on actually getting the math right (percentiles, etc.). In
other systems, we were never quite sure if the operations offered made sense.
Especially percentiles are such a natural and necessary way of reasoning about
microservice performance that it felt great that they get first class
treatment.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2016-10-12/prometheus-dashboard-db-cbc4db3f322.jpg" alt="Database Dashboard"></p>

<p>The integrated service discovery makes it super easy to manage the scrape
targets. For Kubernetes, everything just works out-of-the-box. For some other
systems not running on Kubernetes yet, we use a
<a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul-based</a> approach. All it takes to get an
application monitored by Prometheus is to add the client, expose <code>/metrics</code> and
set one simple annotation on the Container/Pod. This low coupling takes out a
lot of friction between development and operations - a lot of services are
built well orchestrated from the beginning, because it's simple and fun.</p>

<p>The combination of time-series and clever functions make for awesome alerting
super-powers. Aggregations that run on the server and treating both
time-series, combinations of them and even functions on those combinations as
first-class citizens makes alerting a breeze - often times after the fact.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-think-the-future-holds-for-justwatch-and-prometheus?">What do you think the future holds for JustWatch and Prometheus?<a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-you-think-the-future-holds-for-justwatch-and-prometheus" name="what-do-you-think-the-future-holds-for-justwatch-and-prometheus"></a>
</h2>

<p>While we value very much that Prometheus doesn't focus on being shiny but on
actually working and delivering value while being reasonably easy to deploy and
operate - especially the Alertmanager leaves a lot to be desired yet. Just some
simple improvements like simplified interactive alert building and editing in
the frontend would go a long way in working with alerts being even simpler.</p>

<p>We are really looking forward to the ongoing improvements in the storage layer,
including remote storage. We also hope for some of the approaches taken in
<a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/prism">Project Prism</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/vulcan">Vulcan</a> to be backported to core
Prometheus. The most interesting topics for us right now are GCE Service
Discovery, easier scaling, and much longer retention periods (even at the cost
of colder storage and much longer query times for older events).</p>

<p>We are also looking forward to use Prometheus for more non-technical
departments as well. We’d like to cover most of our KPIs with Prometheus to
allow everyone to create beautiful dashboards, as well as alerts. We're
currently even planning to abuse the awesome alert engine for a new, internal
business project as well - stay tuned!</p>
