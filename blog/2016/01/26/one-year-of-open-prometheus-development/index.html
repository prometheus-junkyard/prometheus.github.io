    <h1>One Year of Open Prometheus Development</h1>

      <h2 id="the-beginning">The beginning<a class="header-anchor" href="#the-beginning" name="the-beginning"></a>
</h2>

<p>A year ago today, we officially announced Prometheus to the wider world. This
is a great opportunity for us to look back and share some of the wonderful
things that have happened to the project since then. But first, let's start at
the beginning.</p>

<p>Although we had already started Prometheus as an open-source project on GitHub in
2012, we didn't make noise about it at first. We wanted to give the project
time to mature and be able to experiment without friction. Prometheus was
gradually introduced for production monitoring at
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> in 2013 and then saw more and more
usage within the company, as well as some early adoption by our friends at
Docker and Boexever in 2014. Over the years, Prometheus was growing more and
more mature and although it was already solving people's monitoring problems,
it was still unknown to the wider public.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="going-public">Going public<a class="header-anchor" href="#going-public" name="going-public"></a>
</h2>

<p>Everything changed for us a year ago, in January of 2015. After more than two
years of development and internal usage, we felt that Prometheus was ready for
a wider audience and decided to go fully public with our official <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/prometheus-monitoring-at-soundcloud">announcement
blog post</a>,
a <a href="https://prometheus.io/">website</a>, and a series of
<a href="http://www.boxever.com/tags/monitoring">related</a>
<a href="http://5pi.de/2015/01/26/monitor-docker-containers-with-prometheus/">posts</a>.
We already received a good deal of attention during the first week after the
announcement, but nothing could prepare us for what happened a week later:
someone unknown to us (hello there,
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jjwiseman">jjwiseman</a>!) had submitted
<a href="https://prometheus.io/">the Prometheus website</a> to Hacker News and somehow their
post had made it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8995696">all the way to the top</a>.</p>

<p>This is when things started going slightly crazy in a good way. We saw a sharp
rise in contributors, mailing list questions, GitHub issues, IRC visitors,
requests for conference and meetup talks, and increasing buzz on the net in
general. Since the beginning, we have been very lucky about the quality of our
newly expanded community: The kind of people who were attracted to Prometheus
also turned out to be very competent, constructive, and high-quality
contributors and users. The ideal open-source scenario of receiving a lot of
value back from the community was a reality pretty much from day one.</p>

<p>What does all that Hacker News buzz look like in terms of GitHub stars? Try and
see if you can find the exact moment in this graph (ironically, a Gnuplot and
not Prometheus graph) when we went out of "dark mode" and got hit by Hacker
News:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/prometheus_github_stars-cbcae723947.png"><img src="/assets/prometheus_github_stars-cbcae723947.png" alt="Prometheus GitHub stars"></a></p>

<p>This attention also put us in the 4th place of GitHub's trending repositories
worldwide:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/prometheus_github_trending-cb1730643f7.png"><img src="/assets/prometheus_github_trending-cb1730643f7.png" alt="Prometheus trending on GitHub"></a></p>

<h2 id="after-the-first-wave">After the first wave<a class="header-anchor" href="#after-the-first-wave" name="after-the-first-wave"></a>
</h2>

<p>After those first weeks, the initial onslaught of incoming communication cooled
down a bit, but we were and still are receiving constantly growing adoption.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the ecosystem, we now have:</p>

<ul>
<li>33 repositories in our GitHub organization</li>
<li>~4800 total GitHub stars</li>
<li>200+ contributors</li>
<li>2300+ pull requests (60+ open)</li>
<li>1100+ issues (300+ open)</li>
<li>150+ people in our IRC channel (<code>#prometheus</code> on <a href="http://freenode.net/">FreeNode</a>)</li>
<li>250+ people on the mailing list who have created 300+ threads</li>
<li>20+ Prometheus-related talks and workshops</li>
<li>100+ articles and blog posts</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides countless smaller features and bug fixes to existing projects, the
community has contributed many projects of their own to the Prometheus
ecosystem. Most of them are exporters that translate metrics from existing
systems into Prometheus's data model, but there have also been important
additions to Prometheus itself, such as service discovery mechanisms for
<a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>,
<a href="https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/">Marathon</a> and
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly after making more noise about Prometheus, we also found one contributor
(<a href="https://github.com/fabxc">Fabian</a>) so outstanding that he ended up joining
SoundCloud to work on Prometheus. He has since become the most active developer
on the project and we have him to thank for major new features such as
generalized service discovery support, runtime-reloadable configurations, new
powerful query language features, a custom-built query parser, and so much
more. He is currently working on the new beta rewrite of the
<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager">Alertmanager</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we have been honored to be recognized and adopted by major players in
the industry. <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> is now instrumenting its open-source
container management system <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> natively with
Prometheus metrics. <a href="https://coreos.com/">CoreOS</a> is picking it up for
<a href="https://coreos.com/etcd/">etcd</a>'s monitoring as well. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> is betting on Prometheus for their
internal monitoring. By now, the list of companies using Prometheus in one way
or another has become too long to mention all of them:
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>,
<a href="https://coreos.com/">CoreOS</a>, <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a>,
<a href="http://www.boxever.com/">Boxever</a>,
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="http://www.ft.com/">Financial Times</a>,
<a href="http://improbable.io/">Improbable</a>, <a href="https://www.kpmg.com">KPMG</a>, and many more.
Even the world's largest digital festival,
<a href="https://www.dreamhack.se">DreamHack</a>, has <a href="/blog/2015/06/24/monitoring-dreamhack/">used
Prometheus</a> to keep
tabs on their network infrastructure in 2015, and
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/">FOSDEM</a> will do so in 2016.</p>

<p>The widely popular dashboard builder <a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> also added
native Prometheus backend support in <a href="http://grafana.org/blog/2015/10/28/Grafana-2-5-Released.html">version
2.5</a>. Since
people all around the world are already using and loving Grafana, we are going
to focus on improving Grafana's Prometheus integration and will invest
less energy in our own dashboard builder
<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/promdash">PromDash</a> in the future.</p>

<p>With the Prometheus ecosystem continuing to grow, the first users have started
asking about commercial support. While Prometheus will always remain an
independent open source project, one of our core contributors (<a href="https://github.com/brian-brazil">Brian
Brazil</a>) has recently founded his own company,
<a href="http://www.robustperception.io/">Robust Perception</a>, which provides support
and consulting services around Prometheus and monitoring in general.</p>

<p>On a lighter note, 2015 has also been the year in which Brian proved Prometheus's query
language to be Turing complete by implementing
<a href="http://www.robustperception.io/conways-life-in-prometheus/">Conway's Game of Life in PromQL</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The road ahead<a class="header-anchor" href="#the-road-ahead" name="the-road-ahead"></a>
</h2>

<p>Both personally and technically, we are really excited about what has happened
last year in Prometheus-land. We love the opportunity to provide the world with
a powerful new approach to monitoring, especially one that is much better
suited towards modern cloud- and container-based infrastructures than
traditional solutions. We are also very grateful to all contributors and
hope to continuously improve Prometheus for everyone.</p>

<p>Although Prometheus is relatively mature by now, we have a list of major goals
we want to tackle in 2016. The highlights will be polishing the new
Alertmanager rewrite, supporting full read and write integration for external
long-term storage, as well as eventually releasing a stable 1.0 version of the
Prometheus server itself.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
